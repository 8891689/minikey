# usage

This program only have a few possibles arguments

```

```

the `-u` option is for generate keys without the byte verification, `u` stand for `unverified` keys,  if you don't specify the keys generated will be always valid with the byte verification.

```

```

the `-s 22` or `-s 30` option is for generate only keys of the specified size, `s` stand for `size`, if you don't specify this option the default value is 22

```
./minikeyg -m SECUN34uVQKk3UkMBAiTLSoLTUWfwS
```
the `-m` option is for specify a star key this string need to fit in 22 or 30 characters `m` stand for `minikey`, if you don't specify this option the star value is chossen randomly

```
./minikeyg -a 23456789ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijkmnopqrstuvwxyz
```

the `-a` option is for specify the alphabet to be use I hear that the Series 2 Coin don't have number 1 in his minikey, if you don't specify this optin the defaul alphabet is `123456789ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijkmnopqrstuvwxyz` 

```
./minikeyg -t 2

the `-t` option is for specify the thread number, default number of threads is 1.

```
./minikeyg -r

the `-r` option is to generate just random keys without any special order, `r` stand for `random`. This option is OS dependent and only works with `/dev/urandom`

Of course you can use all the option together to fit you needs.
